            "text": "There is yet a lot about this new coronavirus that is still unknown. Studies suggest that the case fatality rate of the virus is of about 3.5% in mainland China, but the authors suggest considering the range 0.2-3.0% [7] . However, this value seems to be much higher in Italy [8] , suggesting its strong dependence on demographics. In fact, the Chinese Center for Disease Control, released an analysis that showed that the case fatality rate ranged from 0% in children aged 0-9 years old to 14.8% in those over 80 [9] , which implies that countries with a high number of elderly citizens, as is the case of Italy and Portugal, are more prone to having higher death rates. The quick spread of the virus in Europe has led the WHO to declare Europe as the new epicentre of the disease on the 13th of March of 2020 [10] . The rapid growth of the number of active cases presenting severe symptoms has saturated the health services in most countries in the continent, especially in Italy [11] . It is yet unknown when the epidemic will reach an end, but governments throughout Europe have implemented harsh measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus. Yet, as of today there are as many as 77,394 confirmed cases on the European continent, in 46 territories, resulting in 3,457 deaths, and rising [2] [3] . In Portugal, the two first confirmed cases in the Portuguese territory were announced on the 2nd of March, which puts the country slightly behind the curve in the outbreak in the European continent. As of today, there are 642 confirmed cases, 2 deaths, and 3 recovered [12] . Also, the country is on lockdown since the 13th of March 2020, and the Portuguese Parliament declared a State of Emergency today (18th of March 2020). One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I adapted a model of the SIR type used in South-Korea to model the evolution of the active cases of the MERS outbreak in the country back in 2015 [13] . Although there are other models being used [14] [15] , this model seemed most appropriate given that the MERS and the SARS-cov-2 are related illnesses, both provoked by a coronavirus strand, and with similar symptoms, although MERS was much deadlier. In order to fit the parameters and given that there is still very little data in the case of Portugal, I used the data of Italy instead. This allowed me to fit the curve of current active cases in Portugal with a model, which I then use, by implementing the control measure parameters predicted in the model to predict the future number of cases, in three different scenarios (the outof-control scenario, a scenario in which the government is successful in applying control measures and citizens mildly adhere to self-protection measures, and a scenario in which the government fails to completely apply control measures, yet citizens still adhere to some measure of self-protection).",

All other parameters were taken to be \"unknown\". Furthermore, and because the fitting of the model was difficult to achieve, I took \u03b21= \u03b22 = \u03b23 as a first approximation, meaning that the mean transmission coefficient is the same independently of type and setting of the transmission.

In order to obtain the parameters for \uf06c\uf02c\uf064\uf02c and k2, an ersatz value for \uf067 had to be given. In this model, \uf067 is originally defined as \"the clinical outbreak rate in all the infected cases\", which is in itself difficult to understand what it means. In the cases of the fits of \uf06c\uf02c\uf064\uf02c and k2, the ersatz value used for \uf067 had a very strong impact in the results of the other parameters. In fact, as it comes multiplied with \uf073 in the transfer from compartment E(t) to compartments A(t) and S(t), I think the high variation in this value could very well be due to the huge uncertainty there is at the moment for the appropriate incubation time of this virus, which some authors claim can be of up to 27 days [21] , although this number is probably an outlier. Finally, a case of an incubation period of 18 days seems to have been confirmed by a recent study [22] . The other parameters are somewhat less elusive. The obtained value for \uf067=0.0168 is 50% the value obtained by Xia et al [13] of 0.0348, which shows the difference in case fatality rates between the SARS-covid-2 (7.2% currently for Italy), and MERS (estimated at 34%), but then again the value should be 20% of this value and not 50%, further implying that the case fatality rate of the SARScovid-2 is still difficult to determine, and could be higher than previously thought.",

The values provided by Xia et al [13] , when applied to the Portuguese case, seem to provide a very unrealistic scenario, in which the values would immediately start to diminish. Perhaps this made sense in the case of the MERS epidemic, given that it was much more localised that the one provoked by this virus. As such, and for the lack of a better model, I devised two different scenarios in addition to the \"outof-control\" scenario described in the previous section:",

In the first scenario the effectiveness of the control measures seems to be at a maximum, and a maximum of just about 700 cases would be reached. This seems unlikely as of today, there are 641 active cases in the country. In scenario 2, the maximum is shifted to the 20th of April, reaching a maximum number of ~7,000 active cases in the country. In this scenario, the transmission rate has been cut to a half, but the government has not been effective in implementing control measures.

            "text": "Given the huge uncertainties concerning these numbers, and the current lack of knowledge of the ongoing epidemic, it is very hard to make sense of its evolution, even using well-established SIR methods. The current work makes a series of assumptions which may or may not be proven correct in the future, including the incubation period of the virus, which is still not well-known. This proved to be a major source of uncertainty to fit the results, because it had a great influence in the other parameters, especially parameter \uf067, which seems to describe a probability of the person being exposed to the virus being symptomatic or not. Instead this parameter seems to behave in this study as an indicator of the huge uncertainty of the value for the incubation period. Finally, epidemiologists and pathologists will tell you that these parameters, unlike what is considered in this study, are not only not constant, but dependent on time, location, culture, and other factors. It is therefore particularly hard to model the current epidemic of covid-19. Also, this study takes into account the particular situation for one country (Portugal), and we know that in globalised times, the likelihood that new foci of infections arise from outside visitors is also very high. Although currently most government have implemented serious travel restrictions, it is now well-known exactly how this parameter could affect this model, which does not take that into account. In fact, one of the major issues with the SARS-covid-2 virus is that, unlike the other SARS, it seems to be much less contained locally, as is evident by the amount of countries afflicted. The amount of actual active cases is another clear source of uncertainty. This model takes the values of active cases and compares them with official confirmed numbers, which not only may be smaller than the actual cases, as are released at an administratively defined time, which probably does not correspond to something realistic.",

One can think of the scenarios as defining two limits of a likelihood interval, and as such, the actual figure of maximum number of active cases in Portugal will likely be in the interval ~700-7,000 between the 9th-20th of April. This can perhaps serve to advise the competent authorities in taking the appropriate measures. It also serves to show the importance of control and self-protecting measures. It is possible to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. Without them, this model predicts that the figures of active cases would reach a staggering ~40,000 people. It also shows that with the appropriate measures this can be indeed brought down. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.",
