Qualitatively, the cumulated counts curves for Daegu-Gyeongbuk and Sincheonji looks like they are reaching for a plateau, but the curves for the except-Sincheonji and except-Daegu-Gyeongbuk cases do not. R statistics software version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the R0 package 2 was used. For the estimation of the subgroups' R 0 values, we fitted an exponential growth model 3 . Sensitivity analysis of the exponential growth period was performed. The generation time distribution should be obtained from the time lag between all infector-infectee pairs 4 , which is called a serial interval, but it is currently unavailable. Instead, we assumed that the serial interval had a gamma distribution with mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 2.0 \u00b1 1.0, 3.0 \u00b1 1.5, 4.0 \u00b1 2.0, 5.0 \u00b1 2.5, and 6.0 \u00b1 3.0 days. The serial interval could be approximated by referring to the estimated incubation time of COVID-19. Recent research by Guan et al. 5 suggested that the virus has an incubation period of four days with an interquartile range two to seven days. Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggested that the incubation period may range from two to 14 days 6 . Sensitivity tests for the generation time assumptions were performed ( Figure S1 ). Figure 2 shows the estimated R0 for each study subgroup and their 95% confidence intervals (by simulation) with an assumption of 4.0 \u00b1 2.0 .
