It can be also understood as the average number of infections caused by a typical individual during the early stage of an outbreak when nearly all individuals in the population are susceptible to infection. The basic reproduction number reflects the ability of an infection spreading under no control, it has three components (Roy, et al. 1992): R0= CB*N*D\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(2) CB: effective contact rate (C: contact frequency, B: contact efficacy) N: susceptible population size D: infectious phase duration",
