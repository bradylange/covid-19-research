Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the impact of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. Results: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the mean final size and the peak incidence of local outbreaks of COVID-19, provided delays in contact tracing are small. Conclusions: Integrating antiviral drugs together with contact tracing and quarantine is predicted through this model to be an effective tool for the control of local outbreaks of COVID-19.",

We argue that when an individual is quarantined at home, 26 this will only result in a partial reduction of contacts, accounting for contacts with household 27 members and other isolation imperfectness. To compensate for this imperfect isolation, we consider 28 the use of an antiviral compound. We test these different control measures in a simulation study 29 that aims at representing, given the available information, the current COVID-19 epidemic. When such contacts generated between susceptible and infectious people, these can result in an 42 infection event according to a Bernoulli probability value based on the time since infection. This 43 probability is computed, at a precise time point, as the product of two components: the infectious-44 ness measure, \u03bd(t), which quantifies the level of infectiousness over time, and the total amount of 45 infectivity q, i.e. the number of infections over the contact rate [12] . The function \u03bd(t) is defined 46 over the exposed and infectious period, or analogously over the incubation and symptomatic period, 47 along which it integrates to one. This function is scaled to have a similar shape among different 48 infectives, based on their lengths of exposed and infectious period. According to this framework, 49 an infectious individual makes effective contacts at a rate, r(t) given by:",

We describe 159 the action of Remdesivir, however, the proposed investigation can be extended to other antivirals, 160 with the caveat that the efficacy of administering an antiviral compound, in addition to isolation 161 and quarantine, depends on the effectiveness of the respective drug. We show that the use of this 162 compound leads to a substantial reduction of the mean final size and the peak incidence. In ad-163 dition, the number of outbreaks that are most challenging to contain decreases when the antiviral 164 is administered to diagnosed and traced individuals. Therefore, the administration of an antiviral 165 drug, together with isolation and quarantine, is expected to have a major impact in the control of 166 local COVID-19 outbreaks. 167 We remain hopeful that the ongoing clinical trials will reveal an antiviral compound that can be author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

In the left panel, for each scenario we report the probability that a simulation leads to a number of cases smaller than the 10% of the population (purple asterisks). In the right panel, together with the point estimates we report the 2.5% and 97.5 % percentiles.",

Furthermore, in the sensitivity we tested analysis a scenario in which infection134    can be detected only after 4 days since infection, close to the incubation period, limiting the impact 135 of a early isolation. In this case, we also highlight the importance of antiviral drugs.136 Although this model is informed with data on the control of MERS-CoV viral load using prophylaxis 137 with Remdesivir, it stands to reason that different classes of viral inhibitors control the viral load 138 in different ways. Additionally, despite the sequence similarity of MERS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 it 139 remains to be established whether the impact of Remdesivir (or other antivirals) on the viral load 140 is similar. To this end, longitudinal data of the viral load on COVID-19 infected patients treated 141 with different viral inhibitors will be informative. Furthermore, Sheahan et al. [11] demonstrated 142 that the degree of the clinical benefit of Remdesivir for MERS depends on the viral dose and also on 143 the timing of the treatment of the viral inhibitor. A lethal viral dose and delaying the initiation of 144 antiviral treatment failed to fully prevent viral pathogenesis. Although Remdesivir proved effective 145 at reducing the viral load also in these conditions, the argument for an early start of antiviral 146 treatment is evident. Presumably, reducing the viral load with an antiviral compound loses its 147 efficacy in advanced disease as the tissue damage is sustained by inflammatory processes in absence 148 of the viral initiator.
