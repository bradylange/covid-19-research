Meanwhile several other researchers disagreed, for example Dr. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and Dr. Schaffner of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and longtime adviser to the CDC (see the CNN article, Cohen (2020) ). At the time, there was clearly no unimodal opinion. What does the data say? In a recent article, Chinazzi et al. (2020) used the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEAM) to perform infection scenario analyses on China COVID-19 data, using a networked meta-population model focused on transportation hubs. A similar model for the US was reported in Wilson (2020) where their web-app predicts from 150,000 to 1.4 million infected cases by April 30, depending on the intervention scenario. Such complex scenario analysis requires user input such as infection sites and properties of the contagion, and the model is taken at face value. A majority of infection sites are hidden, especially if asymptomatic transmission is significant, and a range of contagion parameters must be deduced, perhaps using domain expertise.",

To do so, we exhaustively search a grid over (k, M 0 ) and for each pair of values, we perform a gradient descent with 4 million iterations to identify the optimal \u03b2 and \u03b3 for that specific k, M 0 . We evaluate the best achievable fits for various (k, M 0 ) in Figure 2(a) .

For robustness, we pick the white square in the middle of the deep-blue region, but note here that it is only one of the models which are consistent with the data. In making predictions, we should consider all equivalent models to get a range for the predictions that are period and initial infections. Blue is better fit, red is worse fit.

The model and the interpretation of its parameters will change once public health protocols kick in. The model may have to be re-calibrated (for example if \u03b2 decreases) and the parameters may have to be reinterpreted (for example \u03b3 is a virulence only in the self-reporting setting, not for random testing). Lastly, the model was learned on USA data. The learned model parameters may not be appropriate for another society. The virulence could be globally invariant, but it could also depend on genetic and demographic factors like age. One certainly expects the infectious force to depend on the underlying social network and interaction patterns between people, which can vary drastically from one society to another and depending on interventions. Hence, one should calibrate the model to country specific data to gain more useful insights.",
