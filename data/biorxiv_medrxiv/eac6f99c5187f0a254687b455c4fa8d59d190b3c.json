Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, userfriendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.",

However, the requirement for advanced technology and skilled personnel and long turn-around time (24 hours) are not feasible for local and referral laboratories. Therefore, a colorimetric loop mediated isothermal amplification, also known as LAMP, was developed to obviate the need for expensive technologies, e.g. real-time PCR and NGS, as well as to shorten the turn-around time to up to 40 minutes (4). However, this assay was a qualitative one and also only the swab samples from limited number of patients (n=7) were included for testing (4) . Most recently a newer generation of single step RT-LAMP were developed to detect SARS COV-2, but these assays were not challenged with real clinical samples obtained from COVID-19 positive patients (5, 6). Therefore, we developed a sensitive, specific, and rapid RT-LAMP assay and its performance was challenged by an extensive number of confirmed COVID-19 (n=47) and negative patients (n=213) relative to qRT-PCR assays approved by two Chinese Food and Drug Administration (qRT-PCR NMPA).

Analytical sensitivity yielded reliable LOD of 500 copies/ml less than 30 minutes regardless of matrix used for serial dilution (Figure 2 ). Of note, our assay could detect 50 copies/ml, but some replicates showed unstable amplification. Therefore, we considered the LOD of 500 copies/ml. Analytical specificity was 100% when used a wide range of closely-and distantly-related viral species, prominent fungal and bacterial species, and human DNA. Moreover, analytical evaluation included a wide range of inhibitors and 500 copies of the simulated viral particles were successfully detected below 30 minutes ( Figure 3 ). In order to evaluate the performance of our assay in clinic, we provided our assay and respective instructions to two clinical centers ( Figure 3 ). In total, 168 patients from center 1, among which 35 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 92 patients from center 2, among which 12 patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases, were recruited. One asymptomatic patient tested positive by qRT-PCR (Ct values 37) and by our RT-LAMP was categorized suspected by in-charge physician and few days later became positive.",

The fact that our assay could not detect four positive patients was owing to using 2.5 less RNA input (2 \u00b5l) relative to qRT-PCR (5 \u00b5l). In the future, we will try to use various RNA input volume (5, 8 , and 10 \u00b5l) to observe if we could obtain a higher sensitivity. Although our RT-LAMP assay was developed to be quantitative, we could not find any pattern and association between the time to positivity by our RT-LAMP assay and the Ct values reported by qRT-PCR when using clinical samples. Therefore, we considered our assay a qualitative one. This fact will show that the analytical valuation should be always accompanied by clinical validation to observe the real capabilities of a given assay and that the results obtained in analytical evaluation step are not always reflected in real-life.",

Each center used a different qRT-NMPA assay as a gold standard technique. SARS-CoV-2 kit from Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co. Ltd, (NMPA approval number 20203400065, with LOD of 1000 copies/ml, Ct cut-off 38), and a kit from DAAN Gene Co., Ltd (NMPA approval number 20203400063, with LOD of 500 copies/ml, cut off Ct value of 40) were used in center one and center two, respectively. Positive patients were divided into two groups by physicians, namely suspected and confirmed. Those suspected were isolated and all became positive The ethics committees of both centers approved the study. Emergency patients (outpatients) with fever of unknown origin or inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19 or other diseases were enrolled and samples such as sputum, swabs and tears were used for evaluation. ABI 7500 were used for amplification and data analysis in both centers. The final LAMP reaction was 25 \u00b5l and contained 21.9 \u00b5l buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 120 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Tween 20), 8 U Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs (Beijing) ltd, Beijing, China), 0.5 U AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio Inc, Dalian, China), 2 \u00b5l RNA template, 1.6 \u03bcMFIP/BIP primers, 0.2 \u03bcM F3/B3 primers, 0.4 \u03bcM LF/LB primers, 7 mM MgSO4 (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), 0.8M betaine (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), 1.4 mM each dNTP (Takara Bio Inc, Dalian, China), 0.5 \u03bcM SYTO-9 (Invitrogen Trading, Shanghai) Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China).

Serial dilutions with the magnitude of log10 containing 50*10 6 cell/ml to 50*10 0 cell/ml pseudotyped virus were performed to determine the limit of detection (LOD). Serial dilution testing was performed in both RNase/DNase free molecular grade water and sputum sample collected from a COVID-19 negative healthy individual. Reproducibility of our LAMP assay (linearity=R 2 value) was assessed by separate serial dilution testing on three occasions, each performed in duplicate. Signal intensity and the time to obtain decent amplification curves were recorded and R 2 values \u22650.98 were considered reliable amplification.
