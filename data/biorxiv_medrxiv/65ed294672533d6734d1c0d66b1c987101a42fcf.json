The unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 owes to its high transmissibility ( 2 ) , pre-symptomatic transmission ( 3 ) , and transmission by asymptomatic infections ( 4 ) . An appreciable fraction of infections are asymptomatic ( 5 ) , and many others result in mild symptoms that could be mistaken for other respiratory illnesses ( 6 ) . These factors point to a potentially large reservoir of unobserved infections ( 7 ) , especially in settings where capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 has been limited ( 8 ) . The United States is one such country in which limited testing has been a major concern, particularly as imported cases, and now local cases, have increased over time ( 9 ) . Until February 27, testing criteria in the US were limited to close contacts of confirmed cases and those with recent travel to China ( 9 ) . This means that any local infections resulting from an unobserved imported infection would have gone unnoticed. Community transmission occurred without notice while testing was still being rolled out ( 10 , 11 ) , albeit to an unknown extent.",

Over the course of February, daily estimates of decreased from our uniform prior down to a low of \u03c1 local 6.4x10 -3 (95% PPI: 2.4x10 -4 -4.8x10 -2 ) on March 1, as increases in simulated local infections outpaced newly reported local cases (Fig. 2B, black) . As testing increased in March (Fig. 2B , red), so too did reported cases ( Fig. 2A , red) and daily estimates of ( Fig. 2B, black) . By \u03c1 local March 12, we estimated to be 0.80 (95% PPI: 0.34 -1.00). Between February 23 (low \u03c1 local estimate of ) and March 8 (last day of verified testing numbers), our daily estimates of \u03c1 local were well correlated with daily numbers of tests administered (Pearson's correlation, \u03c1 local median: 0.57, 95% PPI: 0.48 -0.65). Although these results are consistent with the possibility that testing might have improved case detection in March, they also indicate that case detection was likely very low at times in February when containment might have been feasible. Successful fitting of our model was demonstrated by its predictions of local deaths by March 12 (median: 33, 95% PPI: 9 -74), which were consistent with the 39 reported (Fig. 3 ). Although we did not fit our model to deaths on a daily basis, 85.5% of the deaths predicted by our model occurred within the same range of days over which local deaths were reported (February 29 -March 12). This indicates that, collectively, our model's assumptions about the timing of importation, local transmission, and delay between exposure and death are plausible. Deaths caused by COVID-19 often occur several weeks after exposure ( 22 ) . Thus, our baseline model predicts that there will be a median of 395 (95% PPI: 125 -948) additional deaths as a result of infections that occurred by March 12. Relative to deaths reported by then, this represents an increase by a factor of 12.2 (95% PPI: 7.03 -21.3). There are several limitations of our analysis that should be acknowledged. First, our results were, in some cases, sensitive to deviations from baseline assumptions (Supplementary Text). Although most parameter scenarios we explored resulted in similar cumulative infections, higher values of R 0 and earlier importation resulted in estimates in excess of 100,000 (Fig. S4) . Second, our branching process model assumes exponential growth, which could be affected by social distancing ( 23 ) or the buildup of immunity ( 24 ) . Neither of those factors were likely to have had much influence on local transmission in the US before March 13, however. Third, our parameter assumptions were based on analyses of data collected outside the US. Similar information has proven useful for other pathogens, such as Zika and Ebola ( 25 , 26 ) , in past public health emergencies. Fourth, we did not make use of airline data to model importation ( 27 ) , but future applications of our method could incorporate such data.",

Nonetheless, based on our sensitivity analysis, we conclude that unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US by March 12 likely numbered in the tens of thousands, and quite possibly in excess of 100,000. This result, considered together with extensive pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ( 3 , 4 ) , suggests that the US was well past the possibility of containment by March 12. Other modeling work ( 16 ) suggests that the feasibility of containing SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to the number of infections that occur prior to scale-up of containment efforts. Our estimate that fewer than 10% of local symptomatic infections were detected by surveillance for much of February suggests that a crucial opportunity to limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the US may have been missed. Although the number of tests administered increased in March ( 9 ) , so too did the number of infections and, consequently, the demand for testing.",
