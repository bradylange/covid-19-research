Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 2445 preventable patient infections and at least 1557 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual.

[7] [8] [9] [10] Infection transmission between COVID19 patients and healthcare workers has also been documented. 11 Given the current status of the COVID19 outbreak, the US Surgeon General, 12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 American College of Surgeons (ACS), 14 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) 15 have recommended considering rescheduling or postponing some elective surgeries with the goal of conserving limited resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, and mitigating the risk of \"exposing other inpatients, outpatients, and health care providers to the risk of contracting COVID-19\" from asymptomatic but infectious patients. 14 However, the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Children's Hospital Association have written a joint letter opposing the surgeon general's advice. 12 Going along with the surgeon general's and ACS's recommendations, multiple hospitals, including several major hospital systems in WA, are canceling or postponing elective surgery procedures. 16 17 The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases. Our model can also be adapted to analyze COVID19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Given much of the uncertainty regarding the pathophysiology and epidemiology of COVID19, and the potential policy implications of our results, we chose to focus on lower bounds for preventable infections instead of upper bounds.",

To simplify the calculation for the estimated number of elective outpatient cases in WA, we assumed that the case number was directly proportional to population. We divided 131,506.85 daily cases by the US population estimate of 328 million, 20 then multiplied the quotient by WA's population of 7.6 million, 21 to arrive at approximately 3047 elective outpatient surgeries per day in Washington state.",

Note that the actual number of HCW that patients will interact with can often be higher. The number of patients that each set of perioperative staff works with varies depending on the length of surgery and scheduling preferences.

Because COVID19+ individuals could be asymptomatic and infectious for up to 14 days, we included infected HCW in the workforce for days 1-13 of their infections (during which time they could also infect other HCW and patients), and then removed them from the workforce once they reached day 14 and displayed symptoms.
