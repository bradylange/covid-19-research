The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that caused a viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, 5 China in early December 2019 has evolved into the COVID-19 acute respiratory disease pandemic due to its alarming levels of spread and severity, with a total of 195,892 confirmed infected cases, 80,840 recovered and 7,865 deaths in 153 countries as of March 16, 2020 ([1] ). The seemingly far from the epicenter, old continent became the second-most impacted region after Asia Pacific to date, was declared recovered on February 26 [2] . A 38-year-old man repatriated back to Italy from Wuhan who was admitted to the hospital in Codogno, Lombardy on February 21 was the first secondary infection case (\"patient 1\"). \"Patient 0\" was never identified by tracing the first Italian citizen's movements and 20 contacts. In less than a week, the explosive increase in the number of cases in several bordering regions and autonomous provinces of northern Italy placed enormous strain on the decentralized health system. Following an a dramatic spike in deaths from COVID-19, Italy transformed into a \"red zone\", and the movement restrictions were expanded to the entire country on the 8th of March. 25 All public gatherings were cancelled and school and university closures were extended through at least the next month.",

The first models mainly focused on the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 using dynamic mechanistic 35 mathematical models ( [3, 4, 5, 6] ), but also simple exponential growth models (see e.g. [7, 8] ). Compartmental epidemiological models like SIR, SIRD, SEIR and SEIRD have been proposed to estimate other important epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate and for forecasting purposes (see e.g. [6, 9] ). Other studies have used metapopulation models, which include data 40 of human mobility between cities and/or regions to forecast the evolution of the outbreak in other regions/countries far from the original epicenter in China [3, 10, 11, 5] , including the modelling of the influence of travel restrictions and other control measures in reducing the spread ( [12] .",

However, the incubation period does not 125 generally coincide with the time from exposure to the time that someone starts to be infectious. Regarding COVID-19, it has been suggested that an exposed person can be infectious well before the development of symptoms [15] . With respect to the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, a study in China [16] suggests that it may range from 2-14 days, with a median of 5.2 days. Another study 130 in China, using data from 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities suggested that the median incubation period is 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In our model, as explained above, 1 \u03c3 represents the period from exposure to the onset of the contagious period. Thus, based on the above clinical studies, for 135 our simulations, we have set 1 \u03c3 = 3. Regarding the recovery period, the WHO-China Joint Mission in a study that is based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases has reported a median time of 2 weeks from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases, and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical cases [17] . Based on the above and on the fact that within the subset 140 of confirmed cases the mild cases are the 81% [14] , we have set the recovery period for the confirmed cases' compartment to be \u03b4 c = 1/21 in order to balance 8 .

Answers to these important questions would add critical knowledge in our arsenal to combat the pandemic. The tracing of DAY-300 ZERO, in particular, is of outmost importance. It is well known that minor perturbations in the initial conditions of a complex system, such as the ones of an outbreak, may result in major changes in the observed dynamics. No doubt, a high level of uncertainty for DAY-ZERO, as well as the uncertainty in the actual numbers of exposed people in the total population, raise several barriers 305 in our ability to correctly assess the state and dynamics of the outbreak, and to forecast its evolution and its end. Such pieces of information would lower the barriers and help public health authorities respond fast and efficiently to the emergency.",

To achieve this goal, we addressed a new compartmental SEIRD with two infectious compartments in order to bridge the gap between the number of reported cases and the actual number of cases in the total population. By following the proposed methodological framework, we 315 found that the DAY-ZERO in Lombardy was the 21th of January, a date that precedes by one month the fate of the first confirmed case in Lombardy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the actual cumulative number of infected cases in the total population is around 15 times more the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases. Importantly, based on our simulations, we predict 320 that the fade-out of the outbreak in Lombardy will be by the end of May, if the strict isolation measures continue to hold.",
