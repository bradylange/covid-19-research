With a concomitant effort to combat the virus and to better understand virus etiologies, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), an organization under the South Korean Ministry of Welfare and Health, has made many datasets available online that are unique to COVID-19 confirmed South Korea cases [5] The datasets only include confirmed COVID-19 patients with unique numeric patient identifiers, geographical data, and infection information if available. In an epidemiological dataset, they released the region of the affected patient, the identifier of the person who infected the patient, and the number of contacts with other people. The aim of this report is to create spatial visualizations of early COVID-19 transmission networks in South Korea using these data, which may indicate transmission patterns for each network.",

Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the KCDC.

This person had physical contact with an estimated number of 1,160 individuals in different places such as Shin-Cheonji Church of Jesus and the hospital in Cheongdo. Figure 4 clearly demonstrates how the first patient in this cluster infected eight individuals. This epicenter has been attributed as one of the major events that has led to at least 40 secondary cases in the city of Daegu and almost a half of the country's confirmed cases were linked to this cluster in late February. [8] However, secondary infection information was not available in the dataset, which does not allow visualization of a bigger network. Regardless, the Daegu network shows what is known as a superspreader who contacted 1,160 different patients and started the transmission cluster in Daegu.",

Therefore, visualization of these clusters may be helpful to understand the transmission in addition to epidemiological measures like the reproduction number. A recent paper estimated the reproduction number and the outbreak size of the COVID-19 in South Korea using the deterministic mathematical model. The estimated 0 in the national level was 0.55 while the estimate in Daegu was between 3.47 -3.54.[10] Another estimate of 0 in South Korea was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4 -1.6), calculated using the generalized growth model[9]. These estimates are dynamic, and global estimates of the reproduction numbers may not be easily interpretable for different region-and group-specific transmission clusters.",
