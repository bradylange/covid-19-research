We estimate that deaths on a given day should correlate with infections 3 weeks prior and use this with daily reported deaths to estimate the spot prevalence in the past.

Increasing the mortality would reduce the estimated prevalence but this alone could not make the estimates agree with the confirmed cases in order of magnitude. This methodology would be applicable to many other conditions and relies only on accurate estimate of deaths due to the condition which can easily be confirmed post-mortem and case mortality. Without incubation date or data on disease progression an accurate estimate can still be produced but will not provide temporal information but could be used to estimate the time from infection to death.",
