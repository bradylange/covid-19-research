Whilst this may vary and modify our results in detail, we do not believe that this is likely to change so greatly as to alter our conclusions. Furthermore, we assume that each region behaves as a perfect 'pool' of beds in a way that they may be optimally allocated. Of course this is not necessarily the case, since inter-hospital ICU-to-ICU transfers are not always feasible for both operational and clinical reasons, so the patient load is not necessarily uniformly distributed. We do not have more granular data available to model this, but it is worth considering that it is very possible for an individual hospital to reach a locally critical capacity even before the region as a whole does. In this sense our predictions represent a 'best case' scenario.",

Since UK bed occupancy is typically greater than 80% and may frequently exceed 100%, it is clearly not the case that all open beds can simply be re-allocated for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we have assumed that all adult critical care beds can be used for level 3 or mechanically ventilated ICU patients and, operationally, this may also not be possible. Some specialist ICUs may not be able to reconfigure at all. Thus the precise percentage of additional COVID-19 patients which will actually exhaust routine capacity will vary from unit to unit, particularly in ICUs with a substantial post-operative elective surgical workload. Overall, it seems unlikely that any ICU could routinely accommodate the numbers forecast by our model without provision of surge capacity.",

We have shown that ultra-early data can be used to make time-sensitive forecasts of ICU occupancy. We show, subject to our assumptions, that it is credible that ICU requirements may become challenging within weeks. There remains a significant degree of uncertainty in the predictions due both to limitations of the reporting data and also modelling assumptions. This emphasises the need for the collection of realtime patient-facing local data by initiatives such as CHESS [18] and a dynamic approach to improving models as new data becomes available.",
